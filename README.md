👋 Hi, I’m @bryan-ortiz0

👀 I’m interested in data cleaning and visualization, artificial intelligence and large language models, computer vision, video games, and jiu-jitsu

🌱 I’m currently taking Andrej Karpathy's Neural Networks course on building neural networks from scratch, gaining hands-on experience with Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch and other deep learning tools. Also polishing my SQL skills through BigQuery and Oracle

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects and developing, training, and deploying machine learning models

📫 Feel free to reach out via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryan-ortiz0/). Contact me there for my resume if needed
